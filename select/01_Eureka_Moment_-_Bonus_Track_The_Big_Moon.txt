Take me back
To when I wandered
Vacant seas look tepid
Now I've got the eye
So long eureka moment

Trying to recall
A time when I actually had
Things running through my mind

Oh revelation,
Do me good
Do me good

Take me back
To when I wandered
Shake up force read letters
Ten foot to implore
So long eureka moment

So you could have been the voice of your generation
But then,
You never had the nerve

Oh revelation,
Do me good
Do me good

Go
Oh oh oh!

My finger
My window to the world
Squaring round the hours 'til the end
And I hear it time and time and time again
I've no regrets

So you could have been the voice of your generation
But then,
You never had your nerve

Oh revelation,
Do me good
Do me good
