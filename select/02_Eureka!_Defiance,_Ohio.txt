He has his moustache cut fresh for her
She had her bangs done out to here
And the night was young and the beer was cheap at Texaco

With it's fluorescent lights shinin' down
I almost fell off of my bike twice today
I was tryin' to turn my neck around to see

All the speed,
The weed,
The screamin' into disconnected payphones
I love you Old Town ladies with your windbreakers
Your bleached blonde hair and your menthol cigarettes

All the fog,
The stench,
It's rollin' in from every old pulp mill
I love you Old Town dudes with your dirty shirts
Your sweatpants on and your beards

It's so easy to end up here
The fear, the fear, the fear
Stuck in the syrup of the everyday
