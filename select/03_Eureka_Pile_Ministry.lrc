[01:41.63] I seem to find myself each time I run away
[01:48.05] Don't give me vivid in some yester body (selling) days?
[01:53.44] Sometimes they reappear just like the sands of time
[01:58.90] Or d'ya like some quick sand baby running off my summer wine
[02:28.90] 
[02:26.46] Same faces broken homes
[02:29.27] Those memories have fled
[02:32.71] All tears within me now are dormant or dead
[02:38.18] My veins are bursting with a thirst that you cannot ignore
[03:07.18] 
[02:43.75] Alright Eureka's Pile
[02:46.01] Now my saviour, or my whore
[02:59.51] 
[04:42.23] There's a lot that they don't mind when things aren't what they seem
[04:47.41] I always wake up baby cos I always wake up me
[04:52.87] My life may ain't come to much
[04:55.29] Ignore my history
[05:03.79] 
[04:58.89] Least my Eureka Pile can see some way I feel
[05:09.49] Ain't the way I see (* 2)
[05:21.99] 
[05:25.42] My Eureka Pile and me.
